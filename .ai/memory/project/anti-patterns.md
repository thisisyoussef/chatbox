# Anti-Patterns

Capture failures so they are not repeated.

## Seeded Anti-Patterns

- **Problem**: Treating `.ai/` as product code
- **Example**: Adding app runtime features under `.ai/` instead of `src/` or
  other real product directories
- **Why it failed**: It blurs the boundary between helper scaffolding and the
  actual application.
- **Prevention rule**: Product code lives in the real app directories; `.ai/`
  exists to help build and maintain them.

- **Problem**: Importing repo-specific history into the harness
- **Example**: Copying another project's backlog, deploy notes, or feature
  memory into `.ai/memory/`
- **Why it failed**: The helper harness starts giving the wrong instructions
  for this workspace.
- **Prevention rule**: Keep only generic workflows plus Chatbox-specific durable
  memory.

- **Problem**: Documenting commands that do not exist
- **Example**: Telling the harness to run validation or deploy commands not
  defined in `package.json`
- **Why it failed**: Guidance becomes misleading and wastes time.
- **Prevention rule**: Align the harness with the commands that actually exist
  in this repo.

- **Problem**: Letting current-task notes become a backlog archive
- **Example**: Accumulating long story histories under `.ai/memory/session/`
- **Why it failed**: Current context becomes noisy and harder to trust.
- **Prevention rule**: Move only durable truths into project memory and keep
  session notes concise.

- **Problem**: Implementing new UI directly in code before design approval
- **Example**: Using React/CSS as the first place to explore layout and visual
  direction for a new UI story
- **Why it failed**: Review happens too late, design churn spills into code, and
  the user cannot compare alternatives cleanly.
- **Prevention rule**: Use Pencil after spec/plan, generate 2 or 3 variations,
  and wait for explicit approval before implementation.

- **Problem**: Treating each UI story as a fresh one-off design system
- **Example**: Building every new screen in Pencil from scratch with new tokens
  and components instead of extending a shared foundation
- **Why it failed**: Visual consistency drifts and implementation becomes harder
  to keep coherent.
- **Prevention rule**: Build UI variations on top of the shared Pencil design
  system and extend the foundation intentionally.

- **Problem**: Hand-authoring Pencil `frame` artboards without explicit layout
- **Example**: Creating free-positioned story canvases with `frame` nodes but
  forgetting that Pencil frames use layout behavior unless `layout: "none"` is
  set
- **Why it failed**: Children collapse into unexpected rows or stacks and the
  story file becomes visually broken.
- **Prevention rule**: Re-check the synced `.pen` format docs before editing
  `.pen` files, and set `layout: "none"` on any artboard-style or
  absolute-positioned composition frame.

- **Problem**: Calling a starter library a comprehensive design system
- **Example**: Treating tokens plus a few sample components as a finished
  shared system
- **Why it failed**: The process overestimates library readiness and future
  stories fall back to one-off shapes and ad hoc patterns.
- **Prevention rule**: Use `.ai/docs/PENCIL_DESIGN_SYSTEM_STANDARD.md` and
  label the library honestly as `starter`, `working`, or `comprehensive`.

- **Problem**: Treating direct shell `pencil` access as the default workflow
- **Example**: Probing the shell for a `pencil` binary before checking whether
  Pencil is already connected through MCP
- **Why it failed**: It confuses the real readiness signal and makes the
  workflow look broken even when Pencil MCP is available and fully usable.
- **Prevention rule**: In this repo, Pencil MCP is the default bridge. Verify
  Pencil through `/mcp` first and only treat direct shell CLI usage as an
  optional special case.

- **Problem**: Expecting direct `.pen` file patches to hot-reload in Pencil
- **Example**: Editing a `.pen` file on disk with a normal file patch and then
  expecting the open Pencil canvas to update immediately
- **Why it failed**: Pencil's documented immediate-feedback loop applies to
  MCP/editor-session changes, while external disk edits may leave the open file
  stale until it is reopened or reloaded.
- **Prevention rule**: When live feedback matters, mutate the active design
  through Pencil MCP. If a direct disk patch is unavoidable, assume a reopen or
  reload step is needed in Pencil.

- **Problem**: Calling Phase 0 deployment complete when only docs exist
- **Example**: Writing topology or bootstrap notes about deployment without
  adding a real host config, smoke path, or runnable release entrypoints
- **Why it failed**: Later stories assume infrastructure exists, but there is
  nothing actually deployable or verifiable.
- **Prevention rule**: Treat deployment as incomplete until there is a checked-in
  provider config, a smoke-check path, runnable commands, and explicit deploy
  evidence.
