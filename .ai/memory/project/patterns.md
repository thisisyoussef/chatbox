# Durable Patterns

Capture repeatable patterns that match how this workspace actually works.

## Repo Layout

- Root `.ai/` holds the helper harness only.
- The runnable application lives at the repo root.
- Root-level validation should target the root `package.json`.

## Chatbox App Structure

- Electron main process: `src/main/`
- Preload bridge: `src/preload/`
- Renderer app: `src/renderer/`
- Shared contracts and helpers: `src/shared/`
- Integration and fixture-heavy tests: `test/`
- Smaller colocated tests: `src/__tests__/`
- Product docs: `README.md`, `docs/`, `doc/`

## Testing and Validation

- Tests use Vitest.
- Type checking uses TypeScript strict mode.
- Formatting and linting use Biome.
- Baseline validation set is:
  - `pnpm test`
  - `pnpm check`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm build`
- Orchestration-heavy work should establish traces/evals early through
  `.ai/workflows/trace-driven-development.md` instead of waiting for late debug
  cycles.
- Fresh story branches and worktrees should copy the required local `.env*`
  files from the working `main` setup, run `pnpm install` before project
  commands, and keep copied env files untracked.
- Non-trivial implementation stories should start on fresh `codex/` branches;
  if the current tree is already dirty with another story, isolate the new work
  in a clean worktree rather than sharing the dirty tree.
- Story completion defaults to the full GitHub flow: commit, push, PR, merge to
  `main`, sync local `main`, and branch cleanup unless the user explicitly
  pauses or chooses a different merge path.

## Deployment and Release

- The current hosted web-shell baseline is Vercel with checked-in config in
  `vercel.json`.
- The current Vercel project is `chatbox-web`.
- The canonical web deploy path is `pnpm build:web`, outputting to
  `release/app/dist/renderer`.
- Web smoke verification should use `pnpm serve:web` and
  `GET /healthz.json`.
- Hosted preview verification should use `vercel inspect <preview-url> --wait`
  and a logged-in browser session when Vercel deployment protection blocks
  anonymous HTTP checks.
- Desktop packaging and publish flows remain rooted in `electron-builder.yml`.
- Root `release-*.sh` files are the checked-in entrypoints for release and
  deploy commands referenced by `package.json`.

## Documentation Pattern

- Repo rules and harness truth live at the root.
- Product-specific implementation docs stay in the normal repo docs folders.
- Durable workflow notes go in `.ai/memory/project/`.
- Current-task notes go in `.ai/memory/session/`.
- Standard feature stories usually live in `docs/specs/<story-id>/`.
- Phase-pack or roadmap planning may nest full four-artifact story packets under
  a program folder like `docs/specs/<program-id>/<pack-id>/<story-id>/` when
  the work is being organized as a multi-pack roadmap.

## UI Workflow Pattern

- UI stories keep normal feature-spec and technical-plan artifacts.
- Pencil stories begin by syncing the official docs locally under
  `.ai/reference/pencil/`.
- Visual exploration happens in Pencil after spec/plan and before code.
- Existing UI stories should import the current code surface into Pencil before
  variations are proposed.
- The shared Pencil design-library foundation lives at
  `design/system/design-system.lib.pen`.
- Story authors should review the local `.pen` schema snapshot before
  hand-editing `.pen` files.
- Story-specific Pencil work should live at `design/stories/<story-id>.pen`.
- UI stories should produce 2 or 3 variations and wait for user approval before
  implementation.
- Design-system maturity should be labeled honestly using
  `.ai/docs/PENCIL_DESIGN_SYSTEM_STANDARD.md`.
- The current Chatbox foundation is a first-pass comprehensive library: shared
  primitives, forms, chrome, content patterns, and layout shells should extend
  `design/system/design-system.lib.pen` before story work invents new shapes.
- When UI stories change shared tokens, Pencil variables should be synced with
  the corresponding code-side variables or token files.
- Approved variation details should be recorded in
  `docs/specs/<story-id>/pencil-review.md`.
- Approved Pencil artifacts should stay in the repo workspace so design and code
  can stay in sync and be versioned together.
