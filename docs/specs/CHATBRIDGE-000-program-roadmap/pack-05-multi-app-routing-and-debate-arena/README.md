# Pack 05 - Multi-App Routing and Debate Arena

Operational tracking: [`STATUS.md`](./STATUS.md)

## Current Rebuild Posture

- Phase: 5 of 7
- Primary objectives: O1, O3
- Historical baseline remains checked in through CB-501 to CB-504.
- Active rebuild target after the 2026-04-02 catalog change is Chess, Drawing
  Kit, and Weather.

## Reopened Goal

Keep the reviewed-app platform explainable and host-owned while transitioning
the active flagship set away from Debate Arena and Story Builder without losing
their reference value.

## Active Rebuild Queue

- [CB-504 - Multi-app continuity in a single conversation](./cb-504-multi-app-continuity-in-a-single-conversation/feature-spec.md)

## Post-Pack Follow-Up Stories

## Risks

- Letting the active catalog drift away from the checked-in default runtime.
- Treating legacy Debate Arena or Story Builder proof as if it still satisfied
  the active flagship roadmap.
- Shipping Drawing Kit or Weather on top of a stale launch path or stale seed
  corpus.
- Treating `summaryForModel` alone as the final product shape instead of the
  minimum safe continuity layer for richer native app-state integration.
