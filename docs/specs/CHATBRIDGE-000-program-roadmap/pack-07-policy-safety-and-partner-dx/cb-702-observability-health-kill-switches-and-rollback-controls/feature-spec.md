# CB-702 Feature Spec

## Metadata

- Story ID: CB-702
- Story Title: Observability, health, kill switches, and rollback controls
- Author: Codex
- Date: 2026-03-30
- Related PRD/phase gate: `CHATBRIDGE-000` / Pack 07 - Policy, Safety, and Partner DX

## Problem Statement

A partner platform needs operational control: per-app health, versioned disablement, rollback posture, and visibility into failures before they become user harm.

## Story Pack Objectives

- Higher-level pack goal: Finish ChatBridge as a governable platform rather than a successful demo by adding policy precedence, safety operations, observability, and partner developer tooling.
- Pack primary objectives: O3, O5
- How this story contributes to the pack: Per-app health and lifecycle events are observable.

## User Stories

- As an operator, I want to see app health and disable a bad app version quickly.
- As the host, I want app launch, completion, and failure signals to be first-class observability events.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1: Per-app health and lifecycle events are observable.
- [ ] AC-2: The platform can disable an app or version safely at runtime.
- [ ] AC-3: Rollback and disablement behavior is explicit for active versus new sessions.

## Edge Cases

- Empty/null inputs: host behavior must stay explicit even when the story receives partial or absent runtime data.
- Boundary values: stale state, repeated events, or session reloads must have a documented behavior.
- Invalid/malformed data: validation should fail closed rather than accepting malformed app/platform inputs.
- External-service failures: degraded behavior must keep the conversation usable when network, partner, or storage edges fail.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Security: preserve host authority and validate all new inputs/contracts.
- Performance: avoid blocking streaming or session responsiveness with the new path.
- Observability: emit enough structured state to debug failures in this story's boundary.
- Reliability: degraded and retry behavior must be explicit where applicable.

## UI Requirements

- No dedicated visible UI scope beyond existing host surfaces unless noted in later implementation.

## Out of Scope

- A polished operator dashboard UI
- Open marketplace app ranking/recommendation

## Done Definition

- The accepted behavior is implemented against the existing repo seams.
- Tests cover the primary happy path and the important failure mode for this story.
- Validation passes for the touched scope.
- Any new visible UI state has approved Pencil evidence before code if applicable.
