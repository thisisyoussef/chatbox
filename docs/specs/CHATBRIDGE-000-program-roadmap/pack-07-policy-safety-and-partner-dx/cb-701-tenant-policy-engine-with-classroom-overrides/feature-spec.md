# CB-701 Feature Spec

## Metadata

- Story ID: CB-701
- Story Title: Tenant policy engine with classroom overrides
- Author: Codex
- Date: 2026-03-30
- Related PRD/phase gate: `CHATBRIDGE-000` / Pack 07 - Policy, Safety, and Partner DX

## Problem Statement

The reviewed-app platform needs explicit policy precedence so district guardrails, teacher choices, and classroom context do not conflict unpredictably.

## Story Pack Objectives

- Higher-level pack goal: Finish ChatBridge as a governable platform rather than a successful demo by adding policy precedence, safety operations, observability, and partner developer tooling.
- Pack primary objectives: O3, O5
- How this story contributes to the pack: District-level denies are absolute and lower scopes can only narrow from approved sets.

## User Stories

- As a district or tenant admin, I want hard guardrails that lower scopes cannot override.
- As a teacher, I want to narrow or select from approved apps for my classroom without breaking district policy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1: District-level denies are absolute and lower scopes can only narrow from approved sets.
- [ ] AC-2: Teacher/classroom overrides have explicit precedence and failure behavior.
- [ ] AC-3: Stale policy data fails closed for new app activations.

## Edge Cases

- Empty/null inputs: host behavior must stay explicit even when the story receives partial or absent runtime data.
- Boundary values: stale state, repeated events, or session reloads must have a documented behavior.
- Invalid/malformed data: validation should fail closed rather than accepting malformed app/platform inputs.
- External-service failures: degraded behavior must keep the conversation usable when network, partner, or storage edges fail.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Security: preserve host authority and validate all new inputs/contracts.
- Performance: avoid blocking streaming or session responsiveness with the new path.
- Observability: emit enough structured state to debug failures in this story's boundary.
- Reliability: degraded and retry behavior must be explicit where applicable.

## UI Requirements

- No dedicated visible UI scope beyond existing host surfaces unless noted in later implementation.

## Out of Scope

- Visual admin console design
- Partner SDK code generation

## Done Definition

- The accepted behavior is implemented against the existing repo seams.
- Tests cover the primary happy path and the important failure mode for this story.
- Validation passes for the touched scope.
- Any new visible UI state has approved Pencil evidence before code if applicable.
