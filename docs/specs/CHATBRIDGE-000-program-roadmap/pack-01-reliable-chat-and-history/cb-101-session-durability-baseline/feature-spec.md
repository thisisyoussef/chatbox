# CB-101 Feature Spec

## Metadata

- Story ID: CB-101
- Story Title: Session durability baseline
- Author: Codex
- Date: 2026-03-30
- Related PRD/phase gate: `CHATBRIDGE-000` / Pack 01 - Reliable Chat and History

## Problem Statement

Current session and thread persistence was designed for text, media, reasoning, and tool-call parts. Before ChatBridge adds app lifecycle records, we need a baseline plan for how hydration, export, compaction, and thread history will stay compatible.

## Story Pack Objectives

- Higher-level pack goal: Stabilize the current chat/session substrate so app-backed artifacts can live inside a thread without breaking persistence, export, or recovery semantics.
- Pack primary objectives: O1, O2
- How this story contributes to the pack: Hydration paths for sessions, threads, and compaction points are documented and prepared for app-capable message parts.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want app-backed conversations to survive reloads and session switches so the chat still feels continuous.
- As the host, I want backward-compatible persistence rules so new app artifacts do not corrupt old sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1: Hydration paths for sessions, threads, and compaction points are documented and prepared for app-capable message parts.
- [ ] AC-2: Export and formatting paths have a compatibility plan for app-aware conversations.
- [ ] AC-3: Reload and resume risks are mapped before any flagship app depends on them.

## Edge Cases

- Empty/null inputs: host behavior must stay explicit even when the story receives partial or absent runtime data.
- Boundary values: stale state, repeated events, or session reloads must have a documented behavior.
- Invalid/malformed data: validation should fail closed rather than accepting malformed app/platform inputs.
- External-service failures: degraded behavior must keep the conversation usable when network, partner, or storage edges fail.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Security: preserve host authority and validate all new inputs/contracts.
- Performance: avoid blocking streaming or session responsiveness with the new path.
- Observability: emit enough structured state to debug failures in this story's boundary.
- Reliability: degraded and retry behavior must be explicit where applicable.

## UI Requirements

- No dedicated visible UI scope beyond existing host surfaces unless noted in later implementation.

## Out of Scope

- Rendering a new flagship app
- Bridge protocol or auth design

## Done Definition

- The accepted behavior is implemented against the existing repo seams.
- Tests cover the primary happy path and the important failure mode for this story.
- Validation passes for the touched scope.
- Any new visible UI state has approved Pencil evidence before code if applicable.
