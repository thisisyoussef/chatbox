# CB-201 Task Breakdown

## Story

- Story ID: CB-201
- Story Title: Reviewed app manifest and registry contract

## Execution Notes

- Keep tasks small, verifiable, and mapped to the host-owned contract.
- Do not jump to implementation before the public contract and failure mode are clear.
- Expand visible UI scope only if implementation genuinely requires a surfaced state.
- Preserve existing Chatbox seams and avoid one-off prototypes.

## Story Pack Alignment

- Higher-level pack objectives: O2, O3
- Planned stories in this pack: CB-201, CB-202, CB-203, CB-204
- Why this story set is cohesive: it advances Pack 02 by solving one bounded part of the host/runtime contract.
- Coverage check: this story mainly advances O2, O3.
