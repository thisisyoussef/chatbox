## Problem Statement

The host needs first-class records for app sessions and lifecycle events so it can reason about active state, resumability, completion, and failure independently of the UI.

## Story Pack Objectives

- Higher-level pack goal: Define what an approved app is, how it launches, how it talks to the host, and how the host validates execution and lifecycle events safely.
- Pack primary objectives: O2, O3
- How this story contributes to the pack: The domain model for app instances and app events is explicit and typed.

## User Stories

- As the host, I want appInstance and appEvent records so lifecycle truth is durable and inspectable.
- As a future operator, I want app events to support recovery, troubleshooting, and audit without scraping raw UI state.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1: The domain model for app instances and app events is explicit and typed.
- [ ] AC-2: Lifecycle states, ownership, resumability, and error fields are represented directly.
- [ ] AC-3: The model supports later completion normalization and auth grant linkage.

## Edge Cases

- Empty/null inputs: host behavior must stay explicit even when the story receives partial or absent runtime data.
- Boundary values: stale state, repeated events, or session reloads must have a documented behavior.
- Invalid/malformed data: validation should fail closed rather than accepting malformed app/platform inputs.
- External-service failures: degraded behavior must keep the conversation usable when network, partner, or storage edges fail.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Security: preserve host authority and validate all new inputs/contracts.
- Performance: avoid blocking streaming or session responsiveness with the new path.
- Observability: emit enough structured state to debug failures in this story's boundary.
- Reliability: degraded and retry behavior must be explicit where applicable.

## UI Requirements

- No dedicated visible UI scope beyond existing host surfaces unless noted in later implementation.

## Out of Scope

- Policy evaluation
- Partner auth grant storage

## Done Definition

- The accepted behavior is implemented against the existing repo seams.
- Tests cover the primary happy path and the important failure mode for this story.
- Validation passes for the touched scope.
- Any new visible UI state has approved Pencil evidence before code if applicable.
